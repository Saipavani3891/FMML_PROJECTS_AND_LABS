There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "Reducing Variance\n",

        "1. Single split bias: When you split your data into training and validation sets only once, you may introduce bias. The chosen split might not be representative of the overall data distribution.\n",
        "2. Averaging reduces variance: By averaging validation accuracy across multiple splits, you reduce the variance caused by individual split biases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Improved estimate of model performance: Averaging across multiple splits provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
        "2. Increased robustness: This approach helps mitigate the impact of outliers or noisy data in individual splits.\n",

        "1. Computational cost: Performing k-fold cross-validation can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets or complex models.\n",
        "2. Number of folds (k): Choosing the right value for k is crucial. Common values are 5 or 10. Higher values provide more robust estimates but increase computational cost.\n",
